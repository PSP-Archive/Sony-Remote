Lots of changes in this one guys. Nothing too advanced but will give us
more control of the Devices we got working so far.

For example, by popular demand, I changed the PS2 remote format around
and now we have Start and Select. Hope that helps some of you for the wireless controller
idea. Also, I changed L1 and R1 respectively, to send there signal.

To now change the menu you need to press 

LTrigger + RTrigger when at the PS2 Screen.

The other menus still change with just RTrigger.

Also, in the Sony Wega remote, I added the ability to bring up the On-Screen
Menu. You can navigate around the menu with the Analog Stick. 

Lastly, I added a PS2 DVD Remote Controller so you can play / stop etc from the controller.
Also, the ability to bring up the On-screen menu. (This is also possible with the addition
of the select button on the PS2 Remote).

Well, hopefully I can get to working on some other good features such as learning and a gui.
Both features are far away as I only know how to send SIRCS signals, and no clue on how
to start even thinking about GUI

I guess I don't really have a changelog as I described the changes in detail above.
